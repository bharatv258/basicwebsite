        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technological disruption is prominent almost 
            everywhere -- from smart TVs and technologically advanced kitchen 
            appliances to online games, puzzles and OTTs. 
            A lot more is happening and a lot more is expected to happen in 
            the coming years.
            As a result, many new jobs are being created and a significant number 
            of existing jobs are also being re-defined. This is where computer 
            programming or coding becomes a crucial skill for those 
            searching for the best career prospects or planning to upgrade their existing skills.
            
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Coding is a game-changer and the ones who are skilled in coding h
            ave a competitive advantage in career. It is true that computer 
            programming was once recognised as a skill reserved for computer 
            nerds and geeks but now, it is popular as an essential ability 
            as well as an added advantage for many job profiles.
            It isn't necessarily a thing only for those interested in
             pursuing a career in computer programming. Today, it is also
              a key component of many curriculums, even in primary schools..</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Technological advances don't seem
             to stop as they are rapidly changing the world. Every smartphone app,
              website, computer program and even a microwave and calculator rely on
               a code to operate. Naturally, the demand for digital skills is huge.
                Yet, many young people continue to be digital consumers rather than 
                becoming digital creators.
            As code progressively influences our everyday life, digital skills are 
            becoming crucial for aspiring minds to grow in their career. It is importan
            t for young people to leverage opportunities to enhance digital knowledge
             to grow at the workplace and for better career prospects in future.
             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
             We at Anudip Foundation are here to provide and help people who want to
             reach in such field and provide them necessary training and
